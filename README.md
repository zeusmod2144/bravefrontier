# Scraping Brave Frontier

Brave Frontier is a RPG (Role Playing Game) that available in a smartphone like Android, iOS, Amazon. I love this game since 2015, take a break at 2016 and come back at 2019. For me, this game is awesome.

## What data will you scraping?

- [ ] Scrape list of omni units.
- [ ] Scrape SP and recommended SP of omni units.


## Tech Stack

Previously, I would like to use awesome technology like Puppeteer for scraping. But, [Brave Frontier Fandom's site](https://bravefrontierglobal.fandom.com/wiki/Brave_Frontier_Wiki) is too slow when access Puppeteer in headless mode. So, I choose the boring and proven stack like Cheerio to scraping this site.

## Next after TODO

I would like to consider replace store mechanism data in json file with database like NoSQL.
