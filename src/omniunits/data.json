This build was made with a Mono Thunder team setup in mind. As you are approaching late game, you will need to focus on mono element squads. Although Rhoa may not have the strongest numbers to be the Thunder Elemental Damage lead and buffer. He can be a budget option for this purpose. If you want to keep Rhoa in a mixed element squad, you can forego the Elemental Damage Boost and go for the Enhance Spark Damage Boost instead.","total":100,"list":[{"cost":10,"option":"30% boost to Atk, max HP"},{"cost":10,"option":"Boosts Atk when BB gauge is over 50%"},{"cost":10,"option":"80% boost to Spark damage"},{"cost":30,"option":"Adds huge elemental damage boost for Earth, Thunder types for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB"},{"cost":40,"option":"Adds Spark damage boosts BB gauge for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB"}]}]},{"id":"1623","name":"Demon Manipulator Kafka","element":"Dark","enhancements":[{"cost":10,"option":"30% boost to Atk, max HP","detail_option":""},{"cost":10,"option":"Boosts Atk, Def relative to remaining HP0.5% boost per 1% HP remaining, 50% boost at full HP","detail_option":"0.5% boost per 1% HP remaining, 50% boost at full HP"},{"cost":20,"option":"80% boost to Spark damage","detail_option":"0.5% boost per 1% HP remaining, 50% boost at full HP"},{"cost":10,"option":"Boosts damage against status afflicted foes50% boost","detail_option":"50% boost"},{"cost":10,"option":"Boosts elemental damage50% boost","detail_option":"50% boost"},{"cost":20,"option":"Negates elemental damage","detail_option":"50% boost"},{"cost":20,"option":"Enhances BB's huge damage boost against status afflicted foes effect+20% boost. 190% boost total","detail_option":"+20% boost. 190% boost total"},{"cost":30,"option":"Enhances SBB's considerable Atk, Def boost relative to max HP effect+10% boost. 35% HP to Atk, Def total","detail_option":"+10% boost. 35% HP to Atk, Def total"},{"cost":20,"option":"Enhances SBB's elemental damage boost effect+25% boost. 75% boost total","detail_option":"+25% boost. 75% boost total"},{"cost":50,"option":"Adds considerable BB gauge boost when attacked for 3 turns effect to BB/SBBFills 4-7 BC","detail_option":"Fills 4-7 BC"}],"spRecommendation":[{"title":"General Usage","analysis":"Most of the remaining options are viable to take for future OE+ builds.

There isn't a lot to talk about Ky because his kit is very small and limited to being just a spark buffer with some random support buffs. His SP costs are also on the high side so there isn't a lot you can do with 100 SP. This build picks up the Spark damage boost bb gauge option to give him a utility option. You can choose the Spark Critical and Vulnerability options to give your spark damage a better boost but I personally find these buffs not as useful as the main spark buff.","total":100,"list":[{"cost":20,"option":"20% boost to Def, max HP"},{"cost":10,"option":"Boosts Def when HP is over 50%"},{"cost":20,"option":"Damage taken boosts BB gauge"},{"cost":50,"option":"Adds Spark damage boosts BB gauge for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB"}]}]},{"id":"1642","name":"Elphelt","element":"Light","enhancements":[{"cost":20,"option":"20% boost to Rec, max HP","detail_option":""},{"cost":10,"option":"Boosts Rec when HP is below 50%Boosts Rec by 50%","detail_option":"Boosts Rec by 50%"},{"cost":20,"option":"Negates elemental damage","detail_option":"Boosts Rec by 50%"},{"cost":30,"option":"Enhances SBB's greatly restores HP each turn effect+1000 HP & +10% Rec, 3500~4000 + 25% of healer's Rec total","detail_option":"+1000 HP & +10% Rec, 3500~4000 + 25% of healer's Rec total"},{"cost":30,"option":"Enhances BB/SBB's greatly restores HP effect+1000 HP & +10% Rec, 4100~4400 + 32.5% of healer's Rec total on BB, 4200~4500 + 32.5% of healer's Rec total on SBB","detail_option":"+1000 HP & +10% Rec, 4100~4400 + 32.5% of healer's Rec total on BB, 4200~4500 + 32.5% of healer's Rec total on SBB"},{"cost":30,"option":"Adds status ailment removal effect to BB/SBB","detail_option":"+1000 HP & +10% Rec, 4100~4400 + 32.5% of healer's Rec total on BB, 4200~4500 + 32.5% of healer's Rec total on SBB"},{"cost":40,"option":"Adds probable slight HP restoration when attacked for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB25% chance to recover 20~25% of damage taken","detail_option":"25% chance to recover 20~25% of damage taken"}],"spRecommendation":[{"title":"General Usage","analysis":"Most other options are viable for future OE+ builds in addition to 10 flexible SP - however, the following options are recommended:\n Enhances SBB's greatly restores HP each turn effect (30 SP)\n Negates elemental damage (20 SP)","total":90,"list":[{"cost":20,"option":"Negates elemental damage"},{"cost":30,"option":"Adds status ailment removal effect to BB/SBB"},{"cost":40,"option":"Adds probable slight HP restoration when attacked for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB"}]},{"title":"General Usage II","analysis":"Most other options are viable for future OE+ builds in addition to 10 flexible SP - however, the following options are recommended:\n Enhances SBB's greatly restores HP each turn effect (30 SP)\n Negates elemental damage (20 SP)","total":100,"list":[{"cost":20,"option":"20% boost to Rec, max HP"},{"cost":10,"option":"Boosts Rec when HP is below 50%"},{"cost":30,"option":"Adds status ailment removal effect to BB/SBB"},{"cost":40,"option":"Adds probable slight HP restoration when attacked for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB"}]}]},{"id":"1644","name":"Colossal Spirit Jireid","element":"Thunder","enhancements":[{"cost":10,"option":"30% boost to Atk, max HP","detail_option":""},{"cost":15,"option":"Raises Atk, max HP boost from 30% to 50%","detail_option":""},{"cost":10,"option":"Boosts Atk, Def relative to how high HP remaining is0.8% boost per 1% HP remaining, 80% boost at full HP","detail_option":"0.8% boost per 1% HP remaining, 80% boost at full HP"},{"cost":20,"option":"100% boost to Spark damage","detail_option":"0.8% boost per 1% HP remaining, 80% boost at full HP"},{"cost":10,"option":"Raises Spark damage boost from 100% to 120%","detail_option":"0.8% boost per 1% HP remaining, 80% boost at full HP"},{"cost":10,"option":"Raises Atk parameter limits to 130000","detail_option":"0.8% boost per 1% HP remaining, 80% boost at full HP"},{"cost":20,"option":"Enhances BB/SBB's huge Atk boost against status afflicted foes effect+20% boost. 120%/200% boost total","detail_option":"+20% boost. 120%/200% boost total"},{"cost":30,"option":"Adds probable status ailment infliction to attack for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB15% chance to inflict Injury, Weak, Sick & 10% chance to inflict Curse, Poison, Paralysis","detail_option":"15% chance to inflict Injury, Weak, Sick & 10% chance to inflict Curse, Poison, Paralysis"},{"cost":35,"option":"Adds huge Atk boost relative to Def for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB80% Def to Atk","detail_option":"80% Def to Atk"},{"cost":35,"option":"Adds huge BB Atk boost for 3 turns effect to BB/SBB450% boost","detail_option":"450% boost"}],"spRecommendation":[{"title":"BB ATK build","analysis":"Jireid  has a couple of routes to go in his SP build.
